5 While he was still speaking, look, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son whom I dearly love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
6 Hearing this, the disciples fell on their faces, filled with awe.
7 But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."

10 The disciples asked, "Then why do the legal experts say that Elijah must first come?"
11 Jesus responded, "Elijah does come first and will restore all things.

27 But just so we don't offend them, go to the lake, throw out a fishing line and hook, and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel coin. Take it and pay the tax for both of us."
