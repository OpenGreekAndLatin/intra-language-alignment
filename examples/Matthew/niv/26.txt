7 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
8 When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked.
9 “This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.”
10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
11 The poor you will always have with you,abut you will not always have me. &times; References for Matthew 26:11

14 Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests &times; References for Matthew 26:14
15 and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. &times; References for Matthew 26:15

19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

21 And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.” &times; References for Matthew 26:21
22 They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”

35 But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. &times; References for Matthew 26:35
36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” &times; References for Matthew 26:36
37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. &times; References for Matthew 26:37

43 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
44 So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
45 Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. &times; References for Matthew 26:45
46 Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. &times; References for Matthew 26:47
48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.”
49 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. &times; References for Matthew 26:49
50 Jesus replied, “Do what you came for, friend.”dThen the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. &times; References for Matthew 26:50
51 With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. &times; References for Matthew 26:51

54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?” &times; References for Matthew 26:54
55 In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. &times; References for Matthew 26:55
56 But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. &times; References for Matthew 26:56
57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. &times; References for Matthew 26:57

59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. &times; References for Matthew 26:59

61 and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’ ” &times; References for Matthew 26:61
62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”
63 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.” &times; References for Matthew 26:63
64 “You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”e &times; References for Matthew 26:64
65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. &times; References for Matthew 26:65
66 What do you think?” “He is worthy of death,” they answered. &times; References for Matthew 26:66

68 and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?” &times; References for Matthew 26:68
69 Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said. &times; References for Matthew 26:69
70 But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
71 Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
72 He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
73 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
74 Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.
75 Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly. &times; References for Matthew 26:75
