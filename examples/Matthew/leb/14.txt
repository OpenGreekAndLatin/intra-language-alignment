3 For Herod, [after] arresting John, bound him and put [him] in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, &times; References for Matthew 14:3

12 And his disciples came [and] took away the corpse and buried it, and went [and] told Jesus. &times; References for Matthew 14:12
13 Now [when] Jesus heard [it], he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place by himself. And [when] the crowds heard [it], they followed him by land from the towns. &times; References for Matthew 14:13
14 And [as he] got out, he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them and healed their sick. &times; References for Matthew 14:14
15 Now [when it] was evening, the disciples came to him saying, "The place is desolate and the hour {is late}. Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages [and] purchase food for themselves." &times; References for Matthew 14:15
16 But Jesus said to them, "They do not {need} to go away. You give them [something] to eat." &times; References for Matthew 14:16
17 And they said to him, "We do not have [anything] here except five loaves and two fish." &times; References for Matthew 14:17
18 So he said, "Bring them here to me."
19 And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish [and] looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. And [after] breaking [them], he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds. &times; References for Matthew 14:19
20 And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
21 Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.
22 And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds. &times; References for Matthew 14:22
23 And [after he] sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. So [when] evening came, he was there alone. &times; References for Matthew 14:23

25 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
26 But the disciples, [when they] saw him walking on the sea, were terrified, saying, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear. &times; References for Matthew 14:26
27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Have courage, I am [he]! Do not be afraid!"
28 And Peter answered him [and] said, "Lord, if {it is you}, command me to come to you on the water!" &times; References for Matthew 14:28
29 So he said, "Come!" And getting out of the boat, Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
