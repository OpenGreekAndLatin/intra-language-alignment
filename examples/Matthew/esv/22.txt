1 And again Jesus 1spoke to them in parables, saying, &times; References for Matthew 22:1
2 2"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave 3a wedding feast for his son, &times; References for Matthew 22:2
3 and 4sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. &times; References for Matthew 22:3
4 5Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my 6dinner, 7my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.' &times; References for Matthew 22:4
5 But 8they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, &times; References for Matthew 22:5
6 while the rest seized his servants, 9treated them shamefully, and 10killed them. &times; References for Matthew 22:6
7 The king was angry, and he sent his troops and 11destroyed those murderers and burned their city. &times; References for Matthew 22:7
8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not 12worthy. &times; References for Matthew 22:8
9 Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'
10 And those servants went out into the roads and 13gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. &times; References for Matthew 22:10
11 "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there 14a man who had no wedding garment. &times; References for Matthew 22:11
12 And he said to him, 15'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. &times; References for Matthew 22:12
13 Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and 16cast him into the outer darkness. In that place 17there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' &times; References for Matthew 22:13
14 For many are 18called, but few are 19chosen." &times; References for Matthew 22:14
15 20Then the Pharisees went and plotted how 21to entangle him in his words. &times; References for Matthew 22:15
16 And they sent 22their disciples to him, along with 23the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, 24we know that you are true and teach 25the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for 26you are not swayed by appearances. &times; References for Matthew 22:16
17 Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay 27taxes to 28Caesar, or not?" &times; References for Matthew 22:17
18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why 29put me to the test, you hypocrites? &times; References for Matthew 22:18
19 Show me the coin for the tax." And they brought him a denarius. &times; References for Matthew 22:19
20 And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"
21 They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, 30"Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." &times; References for Matthew 22:21
22 When they heard it, they marveled. And they 31left him and went away. &times; References for Matthew 22:22
23 The same day 32Sadducees came to him, 33who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, &times; References for Matthew 22:23
24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 34'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.' &times; References for Matthew 22:24
25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.
26 So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
27 After them all, the woman died.
28 In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her."
29 But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, 35because you know neither the Scriptures nor 36the power of God. &times; References for Matthew 22:29
30 For in the resurrection they neither 37marry nor 38are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. &times; References for Matthew 22:30
31 And as for the resurrection of the dead, 39have you not read what was said to you by God: &times; References for Matthew 22:31
32 40'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living." &times; References for Matthew 22:32
33 And when the crowd heard it, 41they were astonished at his teaching. &times; References for Matthew 22:33
34 42But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced 43the Sadducees, they gathered together. &times; References for Matthew 22:34
35 44And one of them, 45a lawyer, asked him a question 46to test him. &times; References for Matthew 22:35
36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"
37 And he said to him, 47"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. &times; References for Matthew 22:37
38 This is the great and first commandment.
39 And 48a second is like it: 49You shall love your neighbor as yourself. &times; References for Matthew 22:39
40 50On these two commandments depend 51all the Law and the Prophets." &times; References for Matthew 22:40
41 52Now while the Pharisees 53were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, &times; References for Matthew 22:41
42 saying, "What do you think about 54the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, 55"The son of David." &times; References for Matthew 22:42
43 He said to them, "How is it then that David, 56in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, &times; References for Matthew 22:43
44 57"'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'? &times; References for Matthew 22:44
45 If then David calls him Lord, 58how is he his son?" &times; References for Matthew 22:45
46 59And no one was able to answer him a word, 60nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions. &times; References for Matthew 22:46
