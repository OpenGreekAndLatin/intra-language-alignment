2 After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. &times; References for Matthew 20:2
3 And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
4 and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.'
5 So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.
6 And 1about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' &times; References for Matthew 20:6
7 They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'
8 And 2when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his 3foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' &times; References for Matthew 20:8
9 And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.
10 Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.
11 And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house,
12 saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and 4the scorching heat.' &times; References for Matthew 20:12
13 But he replied to one of them, 5'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? &times; References for Matthew 20:13
14 Take 6what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. &times; References for Matthew 20:14
15 7Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or 8do you begrudge my generosity?' &times; References for Matthew 20:15
16 So 9the last will be first, and the first last." &times; References for Matthew 20:16
