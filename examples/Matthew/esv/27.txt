1 1When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people 2took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. &times; References for Matthew 27:1
2 And they bound him and 3led him away and 4delivered him over to 5Pilate the governor. &times; References for Matthew 27:2
3 Then when 6Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, 7he changed his mind and brought back 8the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, &times; References for Matthew 27:3
4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? 9See to it yourself." &times; References for Matthew 27:4
5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, 10he departed, and he went and hanged himself. &times; References for Matthew 27:5
6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into 11the treasury, since it is blood money." &times; References for Matthew 27:6
7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.
8 Therefore 12that field has been called the Field of Blood 13to this day. &times; References for Matthew 27:8
9 14Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 15"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, &times; References for Matthew 27:9
10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
11 16Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you 17the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, 18"You have said so." &times; References for Matthew 27:11
12 19But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. &times; References for Matthew 27:12
13 Then Pilate said to him, 20"Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" &times; References for Matthew 27:13
14 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
15 21Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. &times; References for Matthew 27:15
16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or 22Jesus who is called Christ?" &times; References for Matthew 27:17
18 For he knew that it was out 23of envy that they had delivered him up. &times; References for Matthew 27:18
19 Besides, while he was sitting on 24the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with 25that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today 26in a dream." &times; References for Matthew 27:19
20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to 27ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. &times; References for Matthew 27:20
21 The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
22 Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"28They all said, "Let him be crucified!" &times; References for Matthew 27:22
23 And he said, "Why, 29what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!" &times; References for Matthew 27:23
24 So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that 30a riot was beginning, he took water and 31washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of 32this man's blood;33see to it yourselves." &times; References for Matthew 27:24
25 And all the people answered, 34"His blood be on us and 35on our children!" &times; References for Matthew 27:25
26 Then he released for them Barabbas, and having 36scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. &times; References for Matthew 27:26
27 37Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the 38governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole 39battalion before him. &times; References for Matthew 27:27
28 And they stripped him and put 40a scarlet robe on him, &times; References for Matthew 27:28
29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they 41mocked him, saying, "Hail, 42King of the Jews!" &times; References for Matthew 27:29
30 And 43they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. &times; References for Matthew 27:30
31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and 44led him away to crucify him. &times; References for Matthew 27:31

35 And when they had crucified him, 49they divided his garments among them by casting lots. &times; References for Matthew 27:35

37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, 51the King of the Jews." &times; References for Matthew 27:37

40 and saying, 57"You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! 58If you are 59the Son of God, come down from the cross." &times; References for Matthew 27:40
41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
42 60"He saved others; 61he cannot save himself. 62He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. &times; References for Matthew 27:42
43 63He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" &times; References for Matthew 27:43
44 64And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. &times; References for Matthew 27:44

47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."

49 But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
50 And Jesus 69cried out again with a loud voice and 70yielded up his spirit. &times; References for Matthew 27:50

57 84When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. &times; References for Matthew 27:57
