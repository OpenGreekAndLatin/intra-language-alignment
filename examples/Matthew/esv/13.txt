13 This is why I speak to them in parables, because 14seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, 15nor do they understand. &times; References for Matthew 13:13

28 He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?'

39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. 53The harvest is 54the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. &times; References for Matthew 13:39
