9 For this could have been sold for a large sum and 12given to the poor." &times; References for Matthew 26:9

40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?

54 81But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?" &times; References for Matthew 26:54

59 Now the chief priests and the whole Council92were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, &times; References for Matthew 26:59
60 but they found none, 93though many false witnesses came forward. At last 94two came forward &times; References for Matthew 26:60
61 and said, "This man said, 95'I am able to 96destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'" &times; References for Matthew 26:61
62 And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?" &times; References for Matthew 26:62
63 97But Jesus remained silent. 98And the high priest said to him, 99"I adjure you by 100the living God, 101tell us if you are 102the Christ, 103the Son of God." &times; References for Matthew 26:63

68 saying, "Prophesy to us, you 114Christ! Who is it that struck you?" &times; References for Matthew 26:68
69 115Now Peter was sitting outside 116in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean." &times; References for Matthew 26:69
70 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."
71 And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus 117of Nazareth." &times; References for Matthew 26:71
72 And again he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man."
73 After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for 118your accent betrays you." &times; References for Matthew 26:73
74 Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed.
