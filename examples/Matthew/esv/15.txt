3 He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
4 For God commanded, 7'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 8'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' &times; References for Matthew 15:4
5 But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, "What you would have gained from me is given to God," &times; References for Matthew 15:5
6 he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have 9made void the word of God. &times; References for Matthew 15:6
7 10You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: &times; References for Matthew 15:7
8 11"'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; &times; References for Matthew 15:8
9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as 12doctrines the commandments of men.'" &times; References for Matthew 15:9
10 And he called the people to him and said to them, 13"Hear and understand: &times; References for Matthew 15:10
11 14it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person." &times; References for Matthew 15:11
12 Then the disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were 15offended when they heard this saying?" &times; References for Matthew 15:12
13 He answered, 16"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted 17will be rooted up. &times; References for Matthew 15:13
14 Let them alone; 18they are blind guides. And 19if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit." &times; References for Matthew 15:14
15 But Peter said to him, 20"Explain the parable to us." &times; References for Matthew 15:15

17 Do you not see that 22whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? &times; References for Matthew 15:17
18 But 23what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. &times; References for Matthew 15:18
19 For out of the heart come 24evil thoughts, 25murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, 26slander. &times; References for Matthew 15:19
20 27These are what defile a person. But 28to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone." &times; References for Matthew 15:20
21 29And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. &times; References for Matthew 15:21
22 And behold, 30a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, 31"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon." &times; References for Matthew 15:22
23 But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, 32"Send her away, for she is crying out after us." &times; References for Matthew 15:23
24 He answered, 33"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." &times; References for Matthew 15:24
25 But she came and 34knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me." &times; References for Matthew 15:25
26 And he answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and 35throw it to the dogs." &times; References for Matthew 15:26
27 She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat 36the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." &times; References for Matthew 15:27
28 Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, 37great is your faith! 38Be it done for you as you desire." 39And her daughter was 40healed instantly. &times; References for Matthew 15:28
29 41Jesus went on from there and walked 42beside the Sea of Galilee. And he 43went up on the mountain and sat down there. &times; References for Matthew 15:29
30 And great crowds came to him, bringing with them 44the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, &times; References for Matthew 15:30
31 45so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, 46the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And 47they glorified 48the God of Israel. &times; References for Matthew 15:31
32 49Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 50"I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way." &times; References for Matthew 15:32
33 And the disciples said to him, "Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?"
34 And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, 51"Seven, and a few small fish." &times; References for Matthew 15:34
35 And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
36 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and 52having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. &times; References for Matthew 15:36
37 And 53they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. &times; References for Matthew 15:37
38 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
39 And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of 54Magadan. &times; References for Matthew 15:39
